# Parallax Website 🌟

A simple and elegant parallax scrolling website built with pure HTML and CSS to practice advanced CSS effects and smooth scrolling animations.

## 🎯 About This Project

This project demonstrates the parallax scrolling effect using only HTML and CSS. The parallax effect creates an illusion of depth by making background images move slower than foreground content while scrolling.

## ✨ Features

- **Parallax Scrolling Effect**: Smooth background image animations on scroll
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Pure CSS**: No JavaScript required
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS-only scroll effects
- **Clean Layout**: Simple and elegant design
- **Optimized Images**: Fast loading background images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and content
- **CSS3** - Styling and parallax effects
- **Images** - Background images for parallax sections

## 🎨 Key CSS Techniques

- **CSS Transform**: `transform: translateZ()` for parallax effect
- **Background Attachment**: `background-attachment: fixed`
- **Viewport Units**: `vh` and `vw` for full-screen sections
- **CSS Positioning**: Creating layered scroll effects
- **Media Queries**: Responsive design breakpoints

## 🎯 How Parallax Works

The parallax effect is achieved using CSS properties:

```css
.parallax {
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The website adapts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full parallax effect
- **Tablet**: Optimized parallax for touch devices
- **Mobile**: Simplified scrolling for better performance
